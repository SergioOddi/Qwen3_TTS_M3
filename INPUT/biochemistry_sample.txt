Cellular Respiration and ATP Production
Today we will discuss the fundamental process of cellular respiration and how cells produce ATP, the energy currency of life.
Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration. In this process, one molecule of glucose, C6H12O6, is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This reaction requires the presence of NAD+ and produces NADH. The net yield is 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule.
The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Here, acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate. This cycle produces 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 GTP per turn. The cycle requires the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions for optimal enzyme activity.
The electron transport chain is the final stage. NADH and FADH2 donate electrons to protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As electrons flow through the chain, they reduce O2 to H2O. This process creates a proton gradient, with H+ ions being pumped across the membrane.
ATP synthase uses this proton gradient to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. The enzyme has a Km value of approximately 10^-5 M for ADP. Under optimal conditions at pH 7.4 and 37°C, one NADH molecule can generate approximately 2.5 ATP molecules, while one FADH2 generates about 1.5 ATP.
The overall efficiency of cellular respiration in converting glucose to ATP is approximately 38%, with the remaining energy released as heat. This process requires adequate levels of O2, maintains cellular pH through the buffering action of CO2 and H2O, and is regulated by the ATP to ADP ratio.
Key regulatory enzymes include phosphofructokinase, which is inhibited by ATP and activated by ADP and AMP. The enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex contains Fe2+ in its active site and requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor.
In summary, cellular respiration efficiently converts the chemical energy in glucose into usable ATP through a series of coordinated reactions involving NAD+, FAD, and the electron transport chain components.
